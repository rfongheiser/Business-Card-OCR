# Running the program
There are two ways to run the program (terminal and file browser):

   ```
   java -jar Business_Card_OCR.jar
   ```
2) Open the file browser and navigate to out/artifacts/Business_Card_OCR and double-click on the Business_Card_OCR.jar file

The User Interface should open. To use the application:

- Paste any business card text into the input box on the left pane of the UI OR select a text file by clicking 'File -> Add Card'
- Click 'Get Info'
- Find the contact info on the right pane

# Testing

I have included three sample texts that you can copy into the text field. They are located in the samples folder.

These sample inputs are included in the written unit tests.
